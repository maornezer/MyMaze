Breadth-First Search (BFS) Explanation:
Queue-Based Exploration: BFS explores the graph or maze level by level. It uses a queue to maintain the order of nodes to be visited. It first processes the start state, then its neighbors, then the neighbors of those neighbors, and so on. This ensures that states closer to the start are explored first, leading to the shortest path in terms of the number of steps.

Tracking Visited States: To avoid revisiting the same state multiple times, a Set is used to track which states have already been visited. This helps avoid unnecessary reprocessing and loops, making the algorithm more efficient.

Parent Map for Path Reconstruction: As BFS progresses, it records the parent of each state (the state from which it was reached) in a Map. This allows the algorithm to trace back the solution once the goal state is found, reconstructing the path from the start to the goal.

Goal Detection: The algorithm checks each state as it is dequeued to see if it matches the goal state. If the goal is reached, the algorithm stops and reconstructs the path to the goal using the parent map.

Guaranteed Shortest Path: BFS guarantees that it finds the shortest path (in terms of the number of steps) in an unweighted graph or maze. This is because it explores all nodes at the current distance from the start before moving on to nodes at the next distance.

Efficiency â€“ Nodes Evaluated: The algorithm keeps track of the number of states (or nodes) it processes during the search. This is important for measuring the performance of the algorithm, as it shows how many nodes were checked before finding the goal.
